# willow

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Note: I didn't add any style or test. I am providing other samples
that have tests and my apps are all properly styled. I enjoyed working on this and focused on functionality, and structure (architecture). I added a bonus feature of adding a page on the fly. I incorporated a form system that I have used in my other projects.
